<p><strong>Labour Electronic Access Forms (LEAF) Agreement </strong></p>
	
  <p>The LEAF Agreement (herein after "Agreement") governs the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Account Holder through its User(s) will have access to the LEAF service for the purpose of completing and submitting electronic Records of Employment ("ROEs") to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission).</p>
  <p>The purpose of LEAF is to provide Account Holders and User(s) with a means to create, submit, print, view, extract and amend (all of which are hereinafter referred to as "manage") electronic ROEs.</p>
  <p>This Agreement contains a number of provisions that may affect the rights and obligations of the Account Holder.</p>
  
  <p><strong>THE ENTIRETY OF THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE READ CAREFULLY</strong></p>
  
  <p>This Agreement is made available to the Account Holder through the Primary Officer who has the authority to accept this Agreement on behalf of the Account Holder.</p>
  <p>The continued access to and use of LEAF are subject to (1) the acceptance of this Agreement, and (2) the Account Holder's compliance with the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.</p>
  
  <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>
  <p>"Account Holder" is an individual or entity obligated to complete and submit their OSH reports to the Labour Program in accordance with the Canada Labour Code.</p> 

 

<p>"Authorization Code" is a random, unique and temporary system generated code that the Account Holder will give to the Primary Officer (PO) in order for the PO to complete the registration to LEAF.</p> 

 

<p>"Main Business Address" means the Account Holder’s business address as registered with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p> 

 

<p>"Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) reports" include the "Employers Annual Hazardous Occurrence Report" or "EAHOR" and the "Hazardous Occurrence Investigation Report" or "HOIR". For the purpose of LEAF, these are the electronic versions of the reports, available for completion within LEAF.</p> 

 

<p>"Representative" is an individual who has been identified and authenticated either by the Primary Officer or another Representative with appropriate access level. Representatives’ responsibilities vary as per the access level assigned to them within LEAF.</p> 

 

<p>"LEAF Account" is the allotted space within the LEAF solution that the Account Holder can use for the purpose set out in this Agreement. A LEAF account is comprised of one agreement, one Primary Officer, may have many Representatives and may have multiple Canada Revenue Agency Business Numbers in relation to which OSH reports are managed by the Account Holder.</p> 

 

<p>"LEAF Enrolment" is the process by which an individual is granted access levels to LEAF Account as a User.</p> 

 

<p>"User(s)" is the generic term referring to the individual(s) authorized to act on behalf of the Account Holder either as a Primary Officer or as a Representative.</p> 

 

<p>"You" refers to the Primary Officer. </p>
  <p><strong>2. Acceptance of terms and conditions</strong></p>
 
 <p>2.1 This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Labour Program will make LEAF available to the Account Holder.</p>
  <p>2.2 By clicking "I Agree" at the end of this Agreement you</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. agree, for and on behalf of the Account Holder, to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. warrant that you have the power and capacity to execute this Agreement on behalf of the Account Holder;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">c. acknowledge and agree, for and on behalf of the Account Holder, that any previous LEAF agreement the Account Holder may have had with The Labour Program is immediately terminated upon accepting this Agreement.</p>
  
  <p><strong>3. Amendment</strong></p>
 
 <p>3.1 The Labour Program reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without prior notice. However, such modifications will only be effective after the expiry of a thirty day notice period commencing on the day the notice of the change is posted in LEAF and on the Service Canada website.</p>
 <p>3.2 The access to or use of the LEAF Account after the expiry of the thirty day period will signify the acceptance of the modified agreement and The Labour Program will be entitled to rely on such access to and use of the LEAF Account as indicating agreement with the change.</p>
 <p>3.3 It is the Account Holder's responsibility to consult LEAF on a regular basis to determine whether any modifications have been posted.</p>
 
 <p><strong>4. Availability of LEAF</strong></p>
 
 <p>4.1 LEAF will be available seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, except</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. during regularly scheduled maintenance or repair; or</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. because of events beyond the control of The Labour Program, or that The Labour Program could not have reasonably prevented by means of controls, compromise, disaster recovery procedures or business continuity procedures.</p>
 <p> 4.2 The Labour Program makes no representations or warranties and disclaims all liability in regards to the availability of</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. LEAF because of events beyond its control, or that The Labour Program could not have reasonably prevented by means of controls, compromise, disaster recovery procedures, or business continuity procedures; or</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. any related technology or intermediary Internet services or systems used to support or access LEAF.</p>
 
 <p><strong>5. No charge to use LEAF</strong></p>
 
 <p>LEAF is free of charge.</p>
 
 <p><strong>6. Responsibilities of the Account Holder</strong></p>

    <p>6.1 The Account Holder is fully responsible for</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. any use of LEAF that is in breach of this Agreement, including the use by any User(s) to whom access to the LEAF Account is granted;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. ensuring that all information provided to The Labour Program through the LEAF Account is true, accurate, current, complete and in compliance with the Employment Insurance Act and Regulations;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">c. implementing processes or mechanisms supporting accurate validation of the identity of each User prior to completion of the LEAF Enrolment. Such processes or mechanisms will be provided to The Labour Program upon request.</p>
    <p>6.2 The Account Holder certifies that the Primary Officer and the Representatives(s) having been granted the appropriate access level, are authorized to use the LEAF Account and to identify and authenticate additional User(s) to act on behalf of the Account Holder for the purpose of LEAF.</p>
    <p>6.3 The Account Holder certifies and warrants that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. identity information provided by User(s) for purposes of LEAF Enrolment is accurate and complete;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. in seeking enrolment to LEAF for its User(s), that it has no information or knowledge that the identity information of these Users as provided to The Labour Program during the enrolment process is inaccurate, incomplete, has changed or has been altered, and;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">c. Users are authorized to be enrolled and use LEAF in accordance with the access level assigned to them.</p>
    <p>6.4 The Account Holder must notify The Labour Program if it knows or suspects that</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. any User's username or password has been or may have been disclosed to anyone;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. any User's username, password or account has been or may have been accessed or used without authorization;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">c. any provision of this Agreement has been or may have been contravened whether by act or omission;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">d. any breach of security that impacts or may impact on the security or integrity of LEAF has occurred.</p>
   <p>6.5. In accordance with the process established by The Labour Program and found on the Service Canada website, the Account Holder must</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. notify The Labour Program of any change of Primary Officer; and</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. have the incoming Primary Officer identified and authenticated.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7. Responsibilities specific to the Account Holder acting as a Service Provider</strong></p>
    
    <p>As a Service Provider, the Account Holder</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. must keep, for audit purposes, the original of each LEAF Client Employer Consent Form signed by a Client Employer authorizing the Account Holder to manage ROEs on their behalf using LEAF. Such records will be maintained in accordance with the retention period provided for under subsections 87(3) and 87(3.1) of the Employment Insurance Act;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. must, upon request, provide The Labour Program with a copy of the signed LEAF Client Employer Consent Form in regard to each Client Employer, identified in the request, who authorizes the Account Holder to manage ROEs on the Client Employer's behalf ; </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">c. must cease to manage ROEs on behalf of a Client Employer who has terminated their authorization and must immediately inform The Labour Program of said termination;</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">d. understands and agrees that a Client Employer may, at any time, notify The Labour Program that they have terminated their authorization and that the Account Holder is no longer authorized to manage ROEs on their behalf.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8. Accuracy</strong></p>
   
   <p>The Account Holder understands and agrees that unless the information contained within LEAF is updated or The Labour Program is notified of any change, The Labour Program is entitled to rely on and act upon the information it receives through LEAF in relation to the Account Holder's account.</p>
   
   <p><strong>9. Protection of Username and Password</strong></p>
   
   <p>9.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Authorization Code assigned to the Primary Officer is personal and not transferable.</p>
   <p>9.2 The Account Holder must ensure that prior to each User LEAF Enrolment, Users understand and agree that their username and password used to access LEAF are unique to them, and that they must maintain the confidentiality of their username and password at all times and must not let any other person use their username and password in order to preserve the security of their electronic communications.</p>
   <p>9.3 The Labour Program disclaims all liability for any loss or damage arising from the failure by the Account Holder or any User(s) to protect usernames, passwords, Authorization Codes or account information, including the Account Holder's failure to meet its obligations under section 9.2. </p>
   
   <p><strong>10. Protection of Account Holder's Computer Networks</strong></p>
   
   <p>The Account Holder warrants that it will install, use and regularly update antivirus software and conduct malicious code scans on all computer equipment used to access LEAF and further warrants that it will install new virus definitions as soon as practical.</p>
   
   <p><strong>11. Revocation of Enrolment to LEAF</strong></p>
   
   <p>11.1 The Account Holder must revoke a User's access to the LEAF Account when</p>
   <p style="padding-left: 20px;">a. the individual ceases to be a User of the LEAF Account;</p>
   <p style="padding-left: 20px;">b. there is any change in the User's identification or authentication information;</p>
   <p style="padding-left: 20px;">c. the User's username or password is compromised or insecure, or suspected of being compromised or insecure;</p>
   <p style="padding-left: 20px;">d. the User fails to meet their obligations under this Agreement.</p>
   <p>11.2 For greater certainty, the revocation of a User's access to the LEAF Account does not affect the access of other Users, and does not terminate this Agreement. If the Account Holder revokes the access of the Primary Officer from LEAF, the Account Holder must replace the Primary Officer and inform The Labour Program of the new Primary Officer as per section 6.5 of this Agreement.</p>
   <p>11.3 The Account Holder must inform Users that their access to the LEAF Account will be revoked where there is reason to believe that any of the circumstances set out in section 11.1 occur.</p>
   <p>11.4 The Labour Program may, in its sole and unfettered discretion and without prior notice, revoke a User's access to LEAF where there is reason to believe that any of the circumstances set out in section 11.1 occur.</p>

   <p><strong>15. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
   
   <p>The Parties hereby undertake to use their best efforts to resolve in an amicable and expeditious manner any dispute or difference that may arise between them under this Agreement, first by negotiation and, failing resolution, then through an independent mediator. Any dispute or difference that has not been resolved by either of these means shall be referred to binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 17 (2nd Supp.)) as amended from time to time.</p>

   <p>16.4 It is understood that the Account Holder or any User may, at any time, withdraw their consent, provided under sections 16.1 and 16.2, by notifying The Labour Program of their decision. If they do so, The Labour Program may not be able to provide them, or continue to provide them, with access to LEAF, in which case ROEs may be submitted by other means by those individuals. Until receipt of such notification, The Labour Program is entitled to rely on the information it possesses.</p>
   
   <p><strong>17. No Partnership</strong></p>
  
  <p>The Labour Program and the Account Holder expressly disclaim any intention to create a partnership, employer /employee relationship, joint venture, joint enterprise or fiduciary relationship.
